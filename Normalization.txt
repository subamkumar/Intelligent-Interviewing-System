By analysis of a systems data storage needs, 
a complex data set is generated.
It has anomalies that can be corrected by
normalization.

Normalization is the process of dividing the
complex data set into multiple smaller and
managable data sets.

A complex dataset is ideally normalized upto
3 levels, that are often called as 3 normal forms.

First Normal Form (FNF):
 1) Every table must have a primary key.
 2) No column of the table be multivalued.
 3) No repeating groups in the table.

Second Normal Form (SNF)
 1) Table must be in first normal form. 
 2) Columns of the table must have functional dependency on the primary key.

Third Normal Form (TNF)
 1) Table must be in second normal form. 
 2) Columns of the table must not have transitional dependency on the primary key.

The column scompanyScale doesnt contribute
to the meaning of the subject.
Its a non functional attribute.
SNF violated. Column must be eleminated.

Table has repeating groups.
FNF violated. Eleminate qop1, qop2, qop3, qop4

question{qid, qtext, qca, qrank }
qoptions{qoid, qoption}

1 A thread is a daemon thread by defaut.	False	2

Relationship
----------------
After normalization the tables have splitted.
They need to be related so that collective 
information can be fetched.

The tables can be related in 3 ways:
1 to 1
 (The primary keys match and are linked)
1 to many
 (The primary key of a table acts as a foreign key of other table)
many to many
 (A third table is formed that holds primary key of 2 tables as foriegn keys)


1 company can have many interviews
and 1 interview is of 1 company
so there exists 1 to many relationship
so PK of company becomes FK of interview

company {cid, cname, curl, cdescription }
1 infosys 	i.com	dfsdgfgfdg
2 tcs     		t.com  	dfghfhfghg
3 accenture	a.com	fdgfhghg

interview {iid, ititle, idescription, ipaypackage, cid } 
1	DBA		gjjgh	7	1
2	Senior Programmer	kjhjkjjlk	8	1
3	HR Manager	lkjlkjlk	5	2
4	Junion Programmer	lkjlkjkl	4	3


1 interview can have many subjects
1 subject can be in many interviews
Many to Many relationship is identified

subject {sid, sname, sdescription}
1	C	dsgfdfg	
2	C++	sdffg	
3	Oracle	dfgfhg	
4	Java	dghgfh	

scaling {scid, sid, iid, scale }
1	1	1	6.7
2	2	1	7.1
3	2	2	8.0
4	3	3	8.5

1 subject has many topics
1 topic can be in 1 subject
so there exists 1 to many relationship
so PK of subject becomes FK of topic

topic {tid, tname, trank, sid }
1	pointers		8.1  1
2	functions		6.5  1
3	file handling	7.6  1

A question belongs to a topic
1 topic will have many questions
So 1 to many relationship is identified between
topic and questions
So the PK of topic be added as the
foriegn key of the questions.

question{qid, qtext, qca, qrank , tid}
1 A thread is a daemon thread by defaut.	False	2 	1	
2 A file can be opened in following modes:	Any	3	2		


1 question can have many qoptions
1 qoption is of 1 question
So 1 to many relationship is identified between
questions and qoptions
So the PK of questions be added as the
foriegn key of the qoptions

qoption{qoid, qoption, qid}
1 True		1
2 False		1
3 ReadM		2
4 WriteM		2
5 RWM		2
6 Any		2
